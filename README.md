## Title of the Project
Hypothyroid Disease Detection using Deep Learning


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The project aims to improve early and accurate diagnosis of hypothyroidism by developing a deep learning model that classifies hypothyroid stages (primary, compensated, or secondary). Using thyroid function test data, it enhances diagnostic efficiency, potentially aiding healthcare providers, especially in areas with limited resources. The project leverages algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, ANN, and XGBoost, and provides a systematic approach from data processing to deployment for clinical use.
